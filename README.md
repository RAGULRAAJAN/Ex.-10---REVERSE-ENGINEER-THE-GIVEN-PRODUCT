### Step 10.:- After generate the gcode format then follow the these instruction 
  ###   ●	Switch on the 3d printer.
  ###   ●	Place your Pen drive in USB.
  ###   ●	Clean your surface bed plate.
  ###   ●	Load your filament into the required extruder as per the requirement.
  ###   ●	Wait until the nozzle & bed plate comes into the required temperature.
  ###   ●	Close the doors of the 3d printer.
  ###   ●	Open the file from the USB storage and select the Print option.
